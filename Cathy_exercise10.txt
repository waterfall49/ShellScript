For directories, this means[13;1H     permission to list the contents of the directory.[K[14;1H  2. permission to write to (change) the file.  For directories, this[K[15;1H     means permission to create and remove files in the directory.[16;1H  3. permission to execute the file (run it as a program).  For[K[17;1H     directories, this means permission to access files in the[K[18;1H     directory.[20;1H   There are three categories of users who may have different[21;1Hpermissions to perform any of the above operations on a file:[23;1H  1. the file's owner;[24;1H  2. other users who are in the file's group;[25;1H  3. everyone else.[27;1H   Files are given an owner and group when they are created.  Usually[28;1Hthe owner is the current user and the group is the group of the[29;1Hdirectory the file is in, but this varies with the operating system, the[30;1Hfile system the file is created on, and the way the file is created.[31;1HYou can change the owner and group of a file by using the 'chown' and[32;1H'chgrp' commands.[34;1H   In addition to the three sets of three permissions listed above, the[35;1Hfile mode bits have three special components, which affect only[36;1H[7m--zz-Info: (coreutils.info.gz)Mode Structure, 82 lines --Top----------------------------------------[0m[1;1H[1;1H   In addition to the three sets of three permissions listed above, the[K[2;1Hfile mode bits have three special components, which affect only[3;1Hexecutable files (programs) and, on most systems, directories:[4;1H[K[5;1H  1. Set the process's effective user ID to that of the file upon[6;1H     execution (called the "set-user-ID bit", or sometimes the "setuid[7;1H     bit").  For directories on a few systems, give files created in the[8;1H     directory the same owner as the directory, no matter who creates[9;1H     them, and set the set-user-ID bit of newly-created subdirectories.[10;1H  2. Set the process's effective group ID to that of the file upon[K[11;1H     execution (called the "set-group-ID bit", or sometimes the "setgid[12;1H     bit").  For directories on most systems, give files created in the[13;1H     directory the same group as the directory, no matter what group the[14;1H     user who creates them is in, and set the set-group-ID bit of[K[15;1H     newly-created subdirectories.[K[16;1H  3. Prevent unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in a[17;1H     directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is called[18;1H     the "restricted deletion flag" for the directory, and is commonly[19;1H     found on world-writable directories like '/tmp'.[20;1H[K[21;1H     For regular files on some older systems, save the program's text[22;1H     image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run;[23;1H     this is called the "sticky bit".[24;1H[K[25;1H   In addition to the file mode bits listed above, there may be file[26;1Hattributes specific to the file system, e.g., access control lists[27;1H(ACLs), whether a file is compressed, whether a file can be modified[K[28;1H(immutability), and whether a file can be dumped.

[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     This manual page documents version 5.11 of the [1mfile[0m command.[m
[m
     [1mfile[0m tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three sets of tests, per‚Äê[m
     formed in this order: filesystem tests, magic tests, and language tests.  The [4mfirst[24m test[m
     that succeeds causes the file type to be printed.[m
[m
     The type printed will usually contain one of the words [4mtext[24m (the file contains only printing[m
     characters and a few common control characters and is probably safe to read on an ASCII ter‚Äê[m
     minal), [4mexecutable[24m (the file contains the result of compiling a program in a form under‚Äê[m
     standable to some UNIX kernel or another), or [4mdata[24m meaning anything else (data is usually[m
     ‚Äúbinary‚Äù or non-printable).  Exceptions are well-known file formats (core files, tar ar‚Äê[m
     chives) that are known to contain binary data.  When modifying magic files or the program[m
     itself, make sure to [4mpreserve[24m [4mthese[24m [4mkeywords[24m.  Users depend on knowing that all the readable[m
     files in a directory have the word ‚Äútext‚Äù printed.  Don't do as Berkeley did and change[m
     ‚Äúshell commands text‚Äù to ‚Äúshell script‚Äù.[m
[m
     The filesystem tests are based on examining the return from a stat(2) system call.  The pro‚Äê[m
     gram checks to see if the file is empty, or if it's some sort of special file.  Any known[m
     file types appropriate to the system you are running on (sockets, symbolic links, or named[m
     pipes (FIFOs) on those systems that implement them) are intuited if they are defined in the[m
     system header file <[4msys/stat.h[24m>.[m
[m
     The magic tests are used to check for files with data in particular fixed formats.  The[m
     canonical example of this is a binary executable (compiled program) a.out file, whose format[m
[7m Manual page file(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     is defined in <[4melf.h[24m>, <[4ma.out.h[24m> and possibly <[4mexec.h[24m> in the standard include directory.[m
[7m Manual page file(1) line 2 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     These files have a ‚Äúmagic number‚Äù stored in a particular place near the beginning of the[m
     file that tells the UNIX operating system that the file is a binary executable, and which of[m
     several types thereof.  The concept of a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù has been applied by extension to data[m
     files.  Any file with some invariant identifier at a small fixed offset into the file can[m
     usually be described in this way.  The information identifying these files is read from the[m
     compiled magic file [4m/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc[24m, or the files in the directory[m
     [4m/usr/share/misc/magic[24m if the compiled file does not exist.  In addition, if [4m$HOME/.magic.mgc[24m[m
     or [4m$HOME/.magic[24m exists, it will be used in preference to the system magic files.[m
[m
     If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is examined to see if it[m
     seems to be a text file.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-ISO 8-bit extended-ASCII character sets[m
     (such as those used on Macintosh and IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded[m
     Unicode, and EBCDIC character sets can be distinguished by the different ranges and[m
     sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in each set.  If a file passes any of[m
     these tests, its character set is reported.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and extended-ASCII[m
     files are identified as ‚Äútext‚Äù because they will be mostly readable on nearly any terminal;[m
     UTF-16 and EBCDIC are only ‚Äúcharacter data‚Äù because, while they contain text, it is text[m
     that will require translation before it can be read.  In addition, [1mfile[0m will attempt to[m
     determine other characteristics of text-type files.  If the lines of a file are terminated[m
     by CR, CRLF, or NEL, instead of the Unix-standard LF, this will be reported.  Files that[m
     contain embedded escape sequences or overstriking will also be identified.[m
[m
     Once [1mfile[0m has determined the character set used in a text-type file, it will attempt to[m
     determine in what language the file is written.  The language tests look for particular[m
     strings (cf.  <[4mnames.h[24m>) that can appear anywhere in the first few blocks of a file.  For[m
     example, the keyword [4m.br[24m indicates that the file is most likely a troff(1) input file, just[m
     as the keyword [4mstruct[24m indicates a C program.  These tests are less reliable than the previ‚Äê[m
     ous two groups, so they are performed last.  The language test routines also test for some[m
     miscellany (such as tar(1) archives).[m
[m
     Any file that cannot be identified as having been written in any of the character sets[m
     listed above is simply said to be ‚Äúdata‚Äù.[m

             Read the names of the files to be examined from [4mnamefile[24m (one per line) before the[m
             argument list.  Either [4mnamefile[24m or at least one filename argument must be present;[m
             to test the standard input, use ‚Äò-‚Äô as a filename argument.  Please note that[m
             [4mnamefile[24m is unwrapped and the enclosed filenames are processed when this option is[m
             encountered and before any further options processing is done.  This allows one to[m
             process multiple lists of files with different command line arguments on the same[m

     The environment variable MAGIC can be used to set the default magic file name.  If that[m
     variable is set, then [1mfile[0m will not attempt to open [4m$HOME/.magic[24m.  [1mfile[0m adds ‚Äú[4m.mgc[24m‚Äù to the[m
     value of this variable as appropriate.  However, [4mfile[24m has to exist in order for [4mfile.mime[24m to[m
     be considered.  The environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT controls (on systems that support[m
     symbolic links), whether [1mfile[0m will attempt to follow symlinks or not.  If set, then [1mfile[0m[m
     follows symlink, otherwise it does not.  This is also controlled by the [1m-L[0m and [1m-h[0m options.[m

     This program is believed to exceed the System V Interface Definition of FILE(CMD), as near[m
     as one can determine from the vague language contained therein.  Its behavior is mostly com‚Äê[m
     patible with the System V program of the same name.  This version knows more magic, however,[m
     so it will produce different (albeit more accurate) output in many cases.[m
[m
     The one significant difference between this version and System V is that this version treats[m
     any white space as a delimiter, so that spaces in pattern strings must be escaped.  For[m
     example,[m
